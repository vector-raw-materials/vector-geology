Structural Modeling
===================


Delve into the world of 3D subsurface modeling with our Structural Modeling tutorials. In this section, we focus on harnessing the capabilities of `gempy`, a powerful tool developed by a partner within the Vector consortium. Hereâ€™s what these tutorials offer:

- **3D Subsurface Modeling**: Learn the intricacies of constructing detailed 3D geological models. We guide you through the process of transforming raw geophysical data into a comprehensive three-dimensional representation of the subsurface.

- **Using gempy**: Discover how to effectively use `gempy` for your modeling needs. Whether you are new to this tool or looking to refine your skills, our tutorials are designed to cater to a range of expertise levels.

- **From Data to Insights**: Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge to not just create models, but also to extract meaningful insights from them. These tutorials bridge the gap between raw data and the decision-making processes in geology.

Prepare to enhance your understanding and skills in geological modeling with a focus on practical, real-world application. By the end of this section, you will be equipped to construct and interpret complex structural models, a crucial skill in the field of geophysical research.
