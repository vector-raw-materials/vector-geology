Vector Geology Examples
-----------------------

Welcome to the Vector Geology Examples section. This space is dedicated to showcasing the diverse capabilities of the 
Vector platform. Here, we illustrate not only what you can achieve with Vector but also guide you on how to implement 
these techniques effectively. Our examples are categorized into distinct areas:

- **Readers and Parsers**: Understand how to interpret and utilize various data formats.
- **Structural Modeling**: Explore methodologies for constructing geological models.
- **Geophysical Forward Engines**: Dive into the simulation of geophysical processes.
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Grasp the nuances of probabilistic approaches in geology.

Each tutorial is designed to provide a practical understanding of Vector's functionalities. While our goal is not to 
cover every feature exhaustively, we aim to offer a comprehensive overview, demonstrating the potential applications 
and methodologies. As each geological setting may require unique approaches, we encourage you to delve into the 
repository's documentation and codebase to uncover the most suitable tools and techniques for your specific needs.

ðŸŒ± **A Living Gallery**: We actively encourage contributions and suggestions. If you have an application, a novel use case, or improvements to existing examples, we welcome your input. This collaborative approach ensures that the gallery not only stays current with the latest developments but also resonates with the needs and discoveries of our users.

So, whether you're here to learn, explore, or contribute, the Vector Geology Examples gallery is your starting point for a journey into the depths of geophysical data processing and analysis.
