Description of work
Task 4.1: Common Earth Models and machine learning data fusion (TER, CSIC, HZDR, GFZ)
Task 4.1 will provide an integrative platform to store, and further interpret the geological, geochemical, and
geophysical data produced in WP2 (TER). Ultimately, the goal is to create fully reproducible scripts to generate
one or several 3D “common earth models” - i.e., quantitative models of the subsurface consistent with as much
data as possible - for each case study of WP2 by the end of the project, including the 3D geometry of the most
relevant geological formations as well as geophysical, petrophysical and petrochemical distributions within each
unit.
- Integrate existing and new compatible software packages to the current open-source geoscientific stack
  packages (e.g. GemPy, subsurface, pyGIMLi, PyVista) (TER, HZDR).35
- Develop machine learning methods to process the raw data into information useful for the construction of the
  common earth models (CSIC, HZDR, GFZ).
- Apply soft labeling and adversarial learning to geophysical data to inform and validate the quality of
  petrophysical distributions over space (HZDR, CISC, GFZ). The joint data will be compared with
  petrophysical data to better understand possible relations between chemistry/rock, composition/mineralogy,
  and petrophysical properties. Resulting relationships will then be utilized to derive vectors toward
  mineralized zones as well as defining the uncertainties associated with these vectors
- Combine the information produced from the different measurements and computations in a Bayesian
  framework. The types of information comprise raw geophysical (Task 2.2), mineralogical (Task 2.3), and
  geochemical (Task 2.4) data, surrogate information obtained from supervised and unsupervised machine
  learning processes, expert geological interpretations (D2.3), and evolutionary simulations (Task 4.1).

# Deliverable 4.3: Open-source toolbox for 3D modelling of multisource data

## Executive Summary

## Introduction
This deliverable represents a collaborative effort, synthesizing multiple software packages
to comprehensively address a broad spectrum of geophysical analysis needs. We begin by
offering an overarching outline of the functionalities encompassed by this toolbox,
irrespective of their individual implementations.
A cornerstone of this project is our commitment to open science, in alignment with the
European Union's policies promoting transparency and accessibility in research. In this
spirit, all software packages developed and integrated within this toolbox are open-source.
This ensures that our tools are not only accessible to the members of the Vector
consortium but also to the wider scientific community, fostering collaboration and
innovation.

To guarantee compliance and clarity in usage rights, each package is provided under one of
three well-established open-source licenses: the European Union Public License (EUPL)
v1.2, the Apache License 2.0, or the MIT License. These licenses were chosen for their
compatibility with the EU's open science objectives, offering a balance between openness
and protection for both developers and users. They ensure that all contributions remain
free and accessible, while allowing modifications and redistributions under the same
terms.Vector Deliverable 4.2

In the latter part of the report, “work description”, we will introduce each open-source
software package, detailing its development and integration within the toolbox's
framework.
