# Deliverable 4.3: Open-source toolbox for 3D modelling of multisource data

## Executive Summary

## Introduction
This deliverable represents a collaborative effort, synthesizing multiple software packages
developed during the vector project.

We begin by offering an overarching outline of the functionalities encompassed by this toolbox,
irrespective of their individual implementations.

A cornerstone of this project is our commitment to open science, in alignment with the
European Union's policies promoting transparency and accessibility in research. In this
spirit, all software packages developed and integrated within this toolbox are open-source.
This ensures that our tools are not only accessible to the members of the Vector
consortium but also to the wider scientific community, fostering collaboration and
innovation.

To guarantee compliance and clarity in usage rights, each package is provided under one of
three well-established open-source licenses: the European Union Public License (EUPL)
v1.2, the Apache License 2.0, or the MIT License. These licenses were chosen for their
compatibility with the EU's open science objectives, offering a balance between openness
and protection for both developers and users. They ensure that all contributions remain
free and accessible, while allowing modifications and redistributions under the same

## Overview
- Repository goals (WP4 goals around geology)
    - Reading data, geomodeling, geophysics
- Multiple packages from different partners. Coordination hell done by Terranigma
- We will explain more in detail some of the work done since the last deliverable D4.2
