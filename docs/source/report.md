# D4.2: Toolbox for joint processing of geophysical and remote sensing data

### Summary


> Development of a toolbox for the joint processing of geophysical and remote sensing data

## Introduction

This deliverable focuses on establishing a shared repository, equipped with tools and examples for reading, manipulating, and inverting various types of data commonly used during exploration phases. Emphasis has been placed on integrating a selection of code packages, primarily contributed by members of the Vector consortium, along with a new repository developed specifically for the Vector project.

In addition to the code essential for performing data inversion, we have included a comprehensive set of tutorials. These guides lead users through typical workflows, from data reading to final optimization processes. Due to intellectual property constraints, all tutorial examples are anonymized, and the datasets required to replicate these examples are exclusive to the Vector consortium. Efforts are underway to address these limitations, aiming to make all materials described in this deliverable freely accessible in the future.

The design of this toolbox emphasizes flexibility and extensibility, catering to the diverse datasets and scientific inquiries encountered during exploration. Recognizing the impracticality of creating a universally exhaustive toolbox, our approach has been to establish a robust framework. This framework can be expanded upon to accommodate specific use cases as they arise.
