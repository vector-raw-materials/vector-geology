# D4.2: Toolbox for joint processing of geophysical and remote sensing data

### Summary


> Development of a toolbox for the joint processing of geophysical and remote sensing data

## Introduction

The goal of this deliverable is to create a shared repository with tools and examples to read manipulate and invert different type of data typically used during exploration phases. The bulk of the work has been put on a selection of code packages - often owned by members of vector - as well as a new repository currently being developed exclusively for the vector project.

Besides actual code, necessary to perform inversion, we provide a quite extensive sets of tutorials guiding the user on a typical workflow from data reading to the final optimizations. Due to interlectual property concerns, all examples are annonimized and datasets to reproduce them will not be provided outside the Vector consortium. The hope is to resolve some of these issues over the duration of the project and trying to make everything described in this deliverable with free access.

This toolbox have been designed to be as flexible and extensible as possible. During exploration phases dataset and scientific questions are quite varied and will need of specific scripts to read formats or transform data in some specific case. Given the impossibility to create an exhaustive toolbox capable to deal with every possible case, we have been prioritizing to build the framework where we can construct on the future to every specific use case.
