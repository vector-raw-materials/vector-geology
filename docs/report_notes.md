Task 4.1: Common Earth Models and machine learning data fusion (TER, CSIC, HZDR, GFZ)
Task 4.1 will provide an integrative platform to store, and further interpret the geological, geochemical, and
geophysical data produced in WP2 (TER). Ultimately, the goal is to create fully reproducible scripts to generate
one or several 3D ‚Äúcommon earth models‚Äù - i.e., quantitative models of the subsurface consistent with as much
data as possible - for each case study of WP2 by the end of the project, including the 3D geometry of the most
relevant geological formations as well as geophysical, petrophysical and petrochemical distributions within each
unit.
- Integrate existing and new compatible software packages to the current open-source geoscientific stack
  packages (e.g. GemPy, subsurface, pyGIMLi, PyVista) (TER, HZDR).35
- Develop machine learning methods to process the raw data into information useful for the construction of the
  common earth models (CSIC, HZDR, GFZ).
- Apply soft labeling and adversarial learning to geophysical data to inform and validate the quality of
  petrophysical distributions over space (HZDR, CISC, GFZ). The joint data will be compared with
  petrophysical data to better understand possible relations between chemistry/rock, composition/mineralogy,
  and petrophysical properties. Resulting relationships will then be utilized to derive vectors toward
  mineralized zones as well as defining the uncertainties associated with these vectors
- Combine the information produced from the different measurements and computations in a Bayesian
  framework. The types of information comprise raw geophysical (Task 2.2), mineralogical (Task 2.3), and
  geochemical (Task 2.4) data, surrogate information obtained from supervised and unsupervised machine
  learning processes, expert geological interpretations (D2.3), and evolutionary simulations (Task 4.1).
