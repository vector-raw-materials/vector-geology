2. Overview of the Toolbox

2.1 Repository Goals

The primary goal of the Vector Geology repository is to provide a comprehensive platform that integrates various software tools and data processing workflows to support geological modeling and analysis. This repository serves as the core component of WP4, focusing specifically on the integration of multisource data to facilitate 3D geological modeling. The repository aims to provide a unified environment that addresses the needs of researchers working with geological, geochemical, and geophysical data, ensuring that all necessary functionalities are accessible through a cohesive open-source framework.

The toolbox offers several key functionalities, including data ingestion, geomodeling, geophysical analysis, and visualization. Data ingestion tools help researchers import and preprocess geological and geophysical datasets, ensuring compatibility with subsequent modeling workflows. Geomodeling capabilities are provided through software such as GemPy, allowing users to construct 3D models of the subsurface, while geophysical analysis tools enable the interpretation of geophysical measurements to derive meaningful geological insights. Finally, visualization tools, including PyVista, are integrated to help users understand and present the results of their analyses effectively.

The toolbox leverages both existing and newly developed software packages to create a comprehensive geoscientific stack. Notable components include GemPy for geological modeling, subsurface for handling borehole data, pyGIMLi for geophysical modeling, and PyVista for 3D visualization. By integrating these packages, the toolbox aims to provide a flexible, extensible platform that can adapt to the evolving needs of the geoscientific community.

2.2 Structure and Coordination

The development of the Vector Geology repository is a collaborative effort involving multiple partners, each contributing their expertise to different aspects of the toolbox. The integration of software packages developed by various partners presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of ensuring compatibility and maintaining a cohesive user experience. Terranigma has taken on the role of coordinating these efforts, streamlining the development and integration of different components to create a unified platform.

The partners contributing to Task 4.1 include TER, CSIC, HZDR, and GFZ, each focusing on specific aspects of the toolbox. TER has played a leading role in developing the core platform and integrating existing geoscientific software. CSIC and HZDR have contributed by developing machine learning methods for data fusion, enabling the transformation of raw geological and geophysical data into actionable information. GFZ has focused on geophysical data analysis and the application of advanced statistical methods to enhance the accuracy of geological models.

The collaborative nature of this project has necessitated the use of robust coordination tools and practices. Regular meetings, shared version control systems, and continuous integration workflows have been employed to facilitate communication and ensure that all contributions are effectively integrated into the repository. Despite the challenges of managing contributions from multiple partners, the coordinated approach has enabled the successful development of a cohesive, functional toolbox.

2.3 Update from Previous Deliverable (D4.2)

Since Deliverable 4.2, significant progress has been made in the development of the Vector Geology toolbox. One of the key advances has been the release of GemPy v3, which provides enhanced capabilities for 3D geological modeling. This new version includes several improvements that make it easier for users to construct complex geological models and integrate multiple data sources into their analyses.

Another major development has been the improvements made to the subsurface package, specifically in the area of well data importing. These enhancements have made it more efficient to bring borehole data into the toolbox, allowing for more accurate and detailed subsurface models. The ability to easily import well data is crucial for constructing reliable geological models, as it provides essential information about the structure and composition of the subsurface.

In addition to software updates, there have been advancements in the integration of machine learning methods for processing raw data to construct common earth models. Techniques such as soft labeling and adversarial learning have been applied to validate the quality of petrophysical distributions, ensuring that the models produced are both accurate and representative of the underlying geological structures. These advancements represent important steps towards the goal of creating fully reproducible and reliable 3D geological models for each case study within WP2.
